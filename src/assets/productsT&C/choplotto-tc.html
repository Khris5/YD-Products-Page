                <p>
                    1.1 Chop Lotto is a lottery game of numbers where subscribers pick 5 numbers out of 90 for a chance to win cash prizes. The drum contains 1-90 numbers and five (5) balls will be drawn from the drum while subscribers wait for the draws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.2 Winning prizes are based on the numbers that matched the winning numbers randomly selected during the draw. Subscribers must match the winning numbers revealed during the draw in no particular order to win. For example, if a subscriber picks 30,12,50,2,1 and the released numbers per game are 80,71,1,5,50, the subscriber who has matched only 2 numbers (1, and 50) is considered a winner for that game.
